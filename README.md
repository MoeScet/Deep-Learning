# Deep-Learning

These are Python tutorials are from uDemy course "Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks" by SuperDataScience.

These tutorials include building 
1. Supervised Deep Learning Models (ANN, CNN and RNN)
2. Unsupervised Deep Learning Models (SOM, Boltzmann Machine and AutoEncoders)
